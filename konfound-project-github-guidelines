## Use commit messages to communicate with others

- Use informative commit messages

## Consider what stage the release should be at

- Development branch on GitHub

- Released on CRAN/through STATA

## Have someone review changes

- Before something makes it from development to master, or master to released, have someone sign-off on the review using GitHub's review features

## Use issues to track issues

- Use GitHub issues to track and assign individauls responsible for issues
